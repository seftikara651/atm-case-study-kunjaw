## Development Requirements

- JDK 11 _(Using OpenJDK or Zulu is RECOMMENDED)_
- Maven 3.8+

## Execution Instruction

- You SHOULD make sure that you've met development requirements before you continue
- It is RECOMMENDED that you read the whole source code to better understand the structure and flow of the template
- You MUST implement features listed under Feature Checklists and SHALL follow rules defined under Constraints, within a timespan of 4 hours
- All specifications of this project are REQUIRED to be implemented
- You MAY start developing the application on `com.tujuhsembilan.App` file, at `start` method
- You MAY modify all source files in this template, without exception, to accomodate your needs; for example: to fix occuring bugs, to match your style of coding, to streamline the program, etc.
- In case of difficulties, you MAY ask any person in charge of monitoring this test
- You MAY also browse the internet to find technical support
- You SHOULD NOT discuss about this project to your colleagues
- It is RECOMMENDED for you to commit your progress on small scale; for example: you commit every time you've done a single feature
- Pushing to repository after every commit is OPTIONAL
- **After you finished this project**, you MAY submit about what you think of this project, or even your personal experience, in the review form at the bottom; be creative! and then you can commit and push once more :)

## Feature Checklists

- [ ] ATM are provided from 4 different banks:

  if you bought a Rp50.000,00 token

## Additional Information

- Some part of these codes are intentionally made error, and contain bugs; you are REQUIRED to fix these
- It is RECOMMENDED to use advanced Java features and coding method, to get better points; for example: OOP, collection stream, proper data type, SOLID, modularism, etc.
- Beautification of the output SHALL NOT have bonus points, so you SHOULD focus on implementing features instead
- This project SHALL NOT connect to database at this point, so you MUST implement data store on underlying `data.repository` package
